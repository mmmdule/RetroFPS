# RetroFPS

RetroFPS is a first-person-shooter created using C# and Unity Engine. Currently the target platform is Windows PC.

The project's main inspiration are 90s FPS games (Doom, Dark Forces, Chasm) now also known as _boomer shooters_. 

## Releases
The [current version](https://shorturl.at/adf01) contains a couple of demo maps, with each of them showing off the base gameplay and enemy/obstacle types.

## Features
- Stylized old-school graphics, with added overlay filters which can be toggled on/off.
- Two enemy and weapon types, with more on the way
- Health and ammo pickups
- Customizable game/episode title, map packs, level textures and endgame messages

## Map Editor
Maps are currently read from a bitmap files stored in the game's StreamingAssets folder. Each pixel on the grid represents an object type which is instantiated during gameplay. 

The [Map Editor desktop app](https://github.com/mmmdule/RetroFPS-LevelEditor) is coming soon, and will allow for much greater map customization with added parameter editing for every object.
