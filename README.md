# RetroFPS

RetroFPS is a first-person-shooter created using C# and Unity Engine. Currently the target platform is Windows PC.

This project was inspired by first-person shooter classics such as idSoftware's DOOM and Wolfenstein 3D. The goal was to create a game that would bring back the fun and excitement of old-school FPS titles, and give our contribution to the modern "boomer shooter" 90s revival genre. 

## Releases
The [first episode](https://shorturl.at/adf01), titled "**_Hellfort Halls_**" contains 9 levels and an original story.
